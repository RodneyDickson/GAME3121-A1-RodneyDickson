This is my assignment 1 submission for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_game}{Game}} 3121 \mbox{\hyperlink{class_game}{Game}} Engine Development I. Player paddle starts with 3 lives and the pong ball will spawn in the centre of screen for a few seconds and then will launch in a random direction as to avoid instant deaths.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_ball}{Ball}} will bounce around a small window with all the game\textquotesingle{}s UI in the bottom to avoid clutter. The player will get 1 point per paddle bounce, and every 10 bounces you gain 1 life. Lose all 3 lives and you can quit the game.
